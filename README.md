## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **UI / Frontend Engineer** focused on building modern, responsive, and reusable interfaces using **JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS**.

My background in **data analytics** helps me approach frontend development with a product mindset — designing interfaces informed by **real data, user behavior, and metrics**, not just visuals.

I’m actively looking for a **Frontend / UI Engineer role** where I can grow, ship real products, and collaborate with designers, analysts, and engineers.
